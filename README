This piece of software is intended to keep track of work that was done by a user
Currently this is accomplished by saving it to a simple text file in the home DIR of the user

TODO
-GUI



PIPE DREAM LIST
-Make this "cloud" based so the work record can be used on any platform
   -This might include making some sort of WEB UI for it (Think of all the fun with AJAX to be had)
-I want to add a daemon that checks if a task has been taking to long and reminds you to get back to work
   -This would be accomplished with BoxCar.
